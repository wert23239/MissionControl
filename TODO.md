# TODO — Bilbo's Action Items 🎯

Things Alex needs from you (the human) to keep moving.

---

## 🔥 High Priority

### Prediction Market Arbitrage
- [ ] **Create a Kalshi account** — <https://kalshi.com> (US regulated, needs KYC)
- [ ] **Set up a Polymarket wallet** — needs USDC on Polygon network
- [ ] **Decide starting capital** — even $500-1000 works for small spreads
- [ ] Share API keys with Alex once accounts are set up

### Book (Hyper Reality)
- [ ] **Review site v3 design** — running on localhost:3000, give feedback on look/feel
- [ ] **Finalize the 8 survey questions** — which map to chapter variants A/B/C
- [ ] **Write the remaining 77 pages** — Alex can help edit/outline but you gotta write
- [ ] **Fiverr logo** — commission the 3/4/5 dice logo (~$15-80)

## 🟡 Medium Priority

### Deployment & Services
- [ ] **Set up Vercel account** — for deploying the book site
- [ ] **Pick a domain name** — for hyperreality site
- [ ] **Set up payment method** — Venmo link at minimum for PDF sales

### Email & Integrations
- [ ] **Himalaya (email)** — need your IMAP server/credentials to configure
- [ ] **Notion** — need API key if you want me connected
- [ ] **ElevenLabs TTS** — $5-22/mo, deferred until revenue justifies it

---

## 🟢 Low Priority / Nice to Have
- [ ] **Twitter/X API key** — if you ever want direct Twitter access (free tier is limited)
- [ ] **Review dashboard** — canvas at localhost:8888/dashboard.html, tell me what to change

## ✅ Alex Can Do Without You
These are things I'll handle on my own, no action needed:
- Install new skills when ClawHub stops rate limiting
- Build the arbitrage bot (once you have accounts)
- Update dashboard with current skill list
- Set up cron jobs for monitoring
- Keep researching opportunities
